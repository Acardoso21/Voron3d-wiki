<h1>Hello and welcome to the Voron3d wiki</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the following are my hopes for this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>have a easily searchable collection of voron modifications alone with the links to their respective github/other links.</li>
  <li>I want to try to keep track of compatibility in-between different mods to help the community find out information more easily.</li>
  <li>attempt to keep a record of the knowledge on discord as a lot of the 3d printing community uses discord servers, which can be hard to search and difficult to read</li>
  <li>keep track of some of the history of the voron project and it's origins</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>more updates coming soon</p>
