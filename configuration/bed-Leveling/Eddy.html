<h3>Eddy USB: Pros and Cons</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong> The Eddy USB is a more advanced version of BTT’s Eddy bed-leveling sensor. Featuring an onboard RP-2040 MCU, this sensor offers a wide range of capabilities, including thermal expansion calibration, making it suitable for more complex, high-temperature printing applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Advanced Features</strong>: With an onboard RP-2040 MCU, the Eddy USB offers advanced features like thermal expansion calibration, ideal for users printing high-temp or engineered filaments.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent MCU</strong>: The built-in MCU allows the Eddy USB to function as a separate controller, handling more complex tasks than a simple sensor. This can improve overall printing accuracy and reliability.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved Calibration</strong>: With features like thermal calibration, the Eddy USB is particularly suited for printing in enclosed environments where temperature fluctuations can affect print quality.</li>
  <li><strong>I2C and USB Capabilities</strong>: In addition to its I2C capability, the USB port offers another means of communication, providing flexibility in how the probe integrates into different setups.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Higher Cost</strong>: The Eddy USB is more expensive than the Eddy Coil due to its advanced features. It may not be a necessary upgrade for all users, especially those with simpler printing needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex Setup</strong>: While more capable, the Eddy USB requires more detailed setup and configuration, which could be overwhelming for users unfamiliar with 3D printer electronics.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation Shortcomings</strong>: Like the Eddy Coil, the Eddy USB suffers from disorganized documentation, which combines both product types. This lack of clarity can make setup more confusing.</li>
  <li><strong>Potential Overkill for Simple Setups</strong>: For users printing standard materials, the advanced capabilities of the Eddy USB might be overkill. In these cases, a simpler and cheaper probe like the Eddy Coil may be sufficient.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> The Eddy USB is an advanced bed-leveling sensor designed for users who need more precise calibration and thermal compensation. It’s best suited for high-temp printing environments or users who require greater accuracy and reliability. However, its higher price and complex setup may not be necessary for all users.</p>
