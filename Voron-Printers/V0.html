<p>below is a generic image of what a voron v0 can look like. Like all voron 3d printers the v0 can be highly customized to create what every type of printer you would like.</p>
<h2>What is a V0</h2>
<p>The voron v0 is a small 3d printer with build area of 120mm<sup>3</sup>. This printer like most vorons uses a coreXY motion system with the bed moves as part of the z axis on a single lead screw</p>
